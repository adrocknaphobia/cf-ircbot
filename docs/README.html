   1.0.0 2005-11-22 Initial version

Installation:

1. Simple binary installation:
	a. Copy examples.jar to WEB-INF/cfusion/gateway/lib/
		(make a backup of the original examples.jar first!)
	b. Copy pircbot.jar to WEB-INF/cfusion/gateway/lib/
	c. Copy the org/ directory to your webroot
	d. Copy ircbot.cfg to your webroot
	e. Restart your ColdFusion MX 7 Developer / Enterprise server
	f. Define a new Gateway Type:
		Type Name:       IRCBot
		Description:     An IRC Bot
		Java Class:      examples.ircbot.IRCBotGateway
		Startup Timeout: 3000
	g. Define a new Gateway Instance:
		Gateway ID:         some name (must be valid in a filename)
		Gateway Type:       IRCBot
		CFC Path:           path to IRCBot.cfc
		Configuration File: path to ircbot.cfg
	h. Start the gateway!
	
2. Source installation (if you want to modify the the behavior of the bot):
	a. Copy the ircbot/ folder to WEB-INF/cfusion/gateway/src/examples/
		(alongside JMS, socket and watcher)
	b. Copy pircbot.jar to WEB-INF/cfusion/gateway/lib/
	c. Use ant to run build.xml in WEB-INF/cfusion/gateway/src/
		The easiest way to do this is inside Eclipse!
		You need to add two external JARs to the build parameters:
			jrun.jar ({jrun.home}/lib/jrun.jar)
			pircbot.jar (from step (b) above)
		This replaces examples.jar in WEB-INF/cfusion/gateway/lib/
	Now perform steps (c) thru (h) from (1) above.

NOTE: I will not provide support for folks attempting the source installation!
If you want to do that, learn how to use the Ant Build... commands in Eclipse!

Read the source of IRCBot.cfc to figure out how to make it behave on channel :)
